i want to implement perceptron learning using numpy and matplotlib to visualize nand and xor gates, update decision boundary after every weight change, show convergence for nand and failure for xor, keep code simple and standard.

WAP to visualize the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using numpy and matplotlib/seaborn in Python. Evaluate performance of a single perceptron for NAND and XOR truth tables as input dataset. We are asked to do this

the Xor one keeps on going and going 

but it must stop at some point for the output na

xor is not linearly separable so perceptron won’t converge right, should i add epoch limit set it to 20 

if epoch limit is reached should i print something like not converged for xor case

what is a clean way to print weights during training without making output messy

i want code to stay simple and standard for assignment, no fancy stuff, is this structure okay

ok give a final code now 

after every epoch in the output seprate every output of every epoch

tell me it is not supposed to converge using Xor gate right? Then writing did not converge within the epoch limit, would mean it can converge afterwards, right? Or is it okay?
